<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a technologist and tinkerer currently located in Urbana, Illinois pursing a PhD in CS at <a href='https://cs.illinois.edu/'>UIUC</a> .</a></p>
<p>While much of my career has been focused on building AI/ML systems for natural language processing and information understanding systems(IR, IE, etc.), my passion is in making solutions which make people more productive.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Mexico City, got a BS in CS at <a href='rpi.edu'>RPI</a>, MS in Computational Linguistics (CS focused NLP) at <a href='http://www.washington.edu/'>UW</a> and have worked at many tech firms along the way.
<p>Outside of work my family and I make wine, ferment food, surf, kiteboard, camp, and renovate houses.</p>
