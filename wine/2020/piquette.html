    <h1>Piquette</h1>
    <h4>Year:2020</h4>
    <h2>Status: Consumed</h2>
    <h4>Grape Origin:<a href='https://www.eclecticvineyards.com'>Eclectic Vineyard</a></h4>
    <h4>Varietal: Cabernet Franc(50%), Syrah(15%), Tempranillo(15%), Chardonnay(20%)</h4>
    <h4>Production:9 Cases</h4>
    <p>Building of the success of of previous year's piquettes we increased production this year to match all the must we produced for the rest of our wines.</p>
    <p>We once again followed [Wild Arc Farm's](https://www.wildarcfarm.com/) style and took all our pressed must and rehydrated it. The rehydrated must was left for 2 weeks before pressing.</p>
    <p>The must then went into fermenters with american oak chips for 4 months and was topped up with 15% wine from the 2020 harvest.</p>
    <p>After 2 rackings we bottle condition with 12g/l of honey and champagne yeast. We are doing small batches and experimenting with additional addatives like hops and citrus rind.</p>
