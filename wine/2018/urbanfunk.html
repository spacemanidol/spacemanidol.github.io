    <p>One afternoon hanging out in a friends back yard a few of us got the idea to see if we could make wine with the grapes. We picked the entire back yard expecting to get enough grapes for 4-6 bottles. When we were done we had buckets full and was clear we would make 30ish bottles. Grapes were destemmed and fermented naturally on skins for 1 month.</p>
    <p>After press, Wine was aged on oak chips for 8 months. No matter what we did the wine still didn't taste great and were not able to save it.</p>
