# 2023 Goal/Plans

Going into a new year I am continuing to be basic by setting some goals/milestones along the way. This year I am building structure and focus around Fs:Fitness, Family, Future, Friends, Fun, and Misc. Damn you miscellaneous why dont you have an F? 

Unlike previous years I am going to track my progress here as the year progresses and I reach or miss goals.
